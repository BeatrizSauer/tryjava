# Task 2.3: Find suitable data types and identifiers

You should define different variables in a programme. Most important ones are int, double and boolean. But there are
others, too.

Find the appropriate data type (that uses as little memory as possible) for a variable, which specifies:

- how many people live in Germany,
- how many people live on Earth,
- whether it's currently daytime,
- the ratio of goals per game of a striker in a football match,
- how many semesters you will study,
- how many students have registered for a degree programme,
- which letter your surname begins with.

Declare the variables inside the Main class by using your identified variable names. Initialize each of the variables
with meaningful values. The output could look like this:

```
Residents Germany: 83100000
World population: 7890000000
Day time: true
Hit rate: 0.1
Number of semesters: 6
Number of students: 678
Surname initial: R
