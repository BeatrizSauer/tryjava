# Task 2.2: Variable declaration and initialization

Let's have variable definitions for each primitive data type in Java and recap on variable declaration and
initialization.

The following variables should be defined in a main method of a class:

- bVar1 as byte
- sVar1 as short
- iVar1 as integer
- lVar1 as long
- fVar1 as float
- dVar1 as double
- isBool1 as boolean
- cVar1 as char

After the declaration, the following values should be assigned to the variables:

| Variable name | Value         |
|---------------|:--------------|
| bVar1         | 5             |
| sVar1         | 400           |
| iVar1         | -356576       |
| lVar1         | 100000000000L |
| fVar1         | 0.123f        |
| dVar1         | 0.123         |
| isBool1       | false         |
| cVar1         | x             |

After the values have been assigned, the programme should output the variables to the console with the instruction
System.out.println.

If the programme has been successfully compiled and executed, and the above values have been output, add further
variables to the programme. Define the following variables and initialise them with the values in the table. During
programme execution, these should also be output to the console.


| Variable name | Value          |
|---------------|:---------------|
| bVar2         | 128            |
| sVar2         | -18453         |
| iVar2         | 2147483648     |
| lVar2         | 345236577970   |
| fVar2         | 4.37456678     |
| dVar2         | 3645.987654321 |
| isBool2       | true           |
| cVar2         | hello          |

What important insights have you gained for dealing with variables and data types from the programme created?

## :point_up: Note

> - When typing an integer number, Java always interpretes it as an int.
> - When typing a floating point number, Java always interpretes it as a double.
