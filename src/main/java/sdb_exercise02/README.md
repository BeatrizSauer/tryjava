# sdb_exercise02

In this exercise, you will learn the following:
- [Task 2.1](task01%2FInstructions.md): Setting up your IDE - IntelliJ
- [Task 2.2](task02%2FInstructions.md): Variable declaration and initialization
- [Task 2.3](task03%2FInstructions.md): Find suitable data types and identifiers
- [Task 2.4](task04%2FInstructions.md): Earnings calculator
- [Task 2.5](task05_optional%2FInstructions.md): (optional) Extended Earnings Calculator

In this exercise you will start coding in your coding IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called IntelliJ. Task 01 
contains all the description. 

You will also learn how to select the correct data types for corresponding variables.

For tasks 2 and 3, the following table might be helpful:

|         |        |                                                 |
|---------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| boolean | 8 bit  | Binary value, which can either be true or false |
| byte    | 8 bit  | Numeric value for small numbers                 |
| char    | 16 bit | Characters                                      |
| short   | 16 bit | Small whole number                              |
| int     | 32 bit | Whole number                                    |
| long    | 64 bit | Large whole number                              |
| float   | 32 bit | Single precision floating point number          |
| double  | 64 bit | Double precision floating point number          |

### :point_up: HINTS:

1. If you are working with the long data type, you must append an `L` to the end of the number. This signals Java 
   that the number should be of type long. If you do not set this `L`, then the number to be written is interpreted 
   as an `int`.

2. The situation is similar with floating-point numbers: if you work with the float type, you must append a `f` at the end of the number. This signals Java that the number should be a float. If you do not set this `f`, then the number to be written is interpreted as double.

In task 4, for the first time, you will write a small piece of code yourself. First think about how you want to 
calculate the result (formula). From this, the variables and their data types can be derived very well.

Have fun!
