# Task 2.4: Earnings calculator

Write a Java programme called SalaryBasic that calculates how much money you have earned with your part-time job. For
example, the hourly salary for this job is EUR 12 and yesterday you worked a total of 7 hours. Define suitable variables
in the programme, as both the hourly salary and hours worked can vary.

The programme should generate the following output:

```
Salary: 12 EUR
Working hours: 7
I have earned  84 EUR
```
