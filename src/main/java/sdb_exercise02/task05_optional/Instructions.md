# Task 2.5: (optional) Extended Earnings Calculator

Extend the earnings calculator from the previous task to take into account both overtime pay and extra pay for public
holidays. Your employer pays you 1.25 times the normal wage for overtime (i.e. working time beyond 8 hours) and a higher
hourly wage of EUR 17.50 on public holidays. Use the appropriate data type for the extra overtime pay, as well as the
indicator whether the hours worked were on public holidays or weekdays.
A possible output could be:

```
Salary with overtime pay: 111.0
```
The following values produced the given output:
- Working hours: 9
- Hourly Salary: 12.00
- Salary for a holiday: 17.50
- Overtime Rate: 1.25
- weekdays: true
  However, these might vary!
